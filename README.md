## Educational Keylogger Demo 

A simple Python tool created for learning how keystroke logging works in a safe and permission‑based environment. It records keys pressed and saves them to a local file to help understand defensive cybersecurity concepts.

## Features
• Logs all keys pressed.  
• Stores logs in keylog.txt.  
• Completely visible and permission‑only (no hiding, no background execution).  
• Press ESC to stop the logger safely.

## How to Use
1. Download or clone the repository containing sanih_keylogger_demo.py.  
2. Make sure Python 3 is installed.  
3. Install the required package:  
   pip install keyboard  
4. Run the script:  
   python sanih_keylogger_demo.py  
5. Press ESC to stop and check keylog.txt for logged keys.

## Ethical Notice
