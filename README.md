## Educational Keylogger Demo 🔑

A simple Python tool created for learning how keystroke logging works in a safe and permission‑based environment. It records keys pressed and saves them to a local file to help understand defensive cybersecurity concepts.

2. Make sure Python 3 is installed.  
3. Install the required package:  
   pip install keyboard  
4. Run the script:  
   python sanih_keylogger_demo.py  
5. Press ESC to stop and check keylog.txt for logged keys.
